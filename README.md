# iOS-first-App-Halloween

  I honestly do not know which files are mandatory to have yet and which ones i can get rid of, but I think having the entire project folder should help run this application.
  The application was made in Xcode using Swift, and took me about 6 hours, with all of the debugging. The app contains 2 views :
  -First view: displays an image, and has 2 buttons(Shuffle - changes the image randomly from the images in the Assets folder, Next-sends the user to the next view)
  -2nd view: contains a field where you can enter your name and a button (Done: tells you to "Bring your own broom")
